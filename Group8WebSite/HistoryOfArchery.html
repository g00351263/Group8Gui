				<h1>Archery</h1>
				<p><b>Archery</b> is the sport, practice or skill of using a bow to propel arrows. 
				The word comes from the Latin arcus.<br/> Historically, archery has been used for hunting and combat. 
				In modern times, it is mainly a competitive sport and recreational activity.
				A person who participates in archery is typically called an archer or a bowman,<br/> 
				and a person who is fond of or an expert at archery is sometimes called a toxophilite</p>
				
				<h3>History</h3>
				<p><b>The bow and arrow</b> seems to have been invented in the later Paleolithic or early Mesolithic periods. <br/>
				The oldest signs of its use in Europe come from the Stellmoor in the Ahrensburg valley north of Hamburg, Germany and dates from the late 
				Paleolithic, about 10,000 to 9000 BC. 
				The arrows were made of pine and consisted of a mainshaft and a 15 to 20 centimetres (5.9 to 7.9 inches) long fore shaft with a flint point. 
				There are no definite earlier bows; previous pointed shafts are known, but may have been launched by spear-throwers rather than bows. 
				The oldest bows known so far come from the Holmegard swamp in Denmark.</p>

				<p>Bows eventually replaced the spear-thrower as the predominant means for launching shafted projectiles, on every continent except 
				Australasia, though spear-throwers persisted alongside the bow in parts of the Americas, notably Mexico and among the Inuit.
				Bows and arrows have been present in Egyptian culture since its predynastic origins. In the Levant, artifacts that could be arrow-shaft 
				straighteners are known from the Natufian culture, (c. 10,800 to 8,300 BC) onwards. The Khiamian and PPN A shouldered Khiam-points may well be 
				arrowheads.</p>

				<p><b>Classical civilizations</b>, notably the Assyrians, Greeks, Armenians, Persians, Parthians, Indians, Koreans, Chinese, and Japanese 
				fielded large numbers of archers in their armies. Akkadians were the first to use composite bows in war according to the victory stele of 
				Naram-Sin of Akkad. Egyptians used composite bows for warfare already from the 16th Century BC while the Bronze Age Aegean Cultures were able 
				to deploy a number of state-owned specialised bowmakers for warfare and hunting purposes already from the 15th century BC. 
				The Welsh longbow proved its worth for the first time in Continental warfare at the Battle of Crecy. In the Americas archery was widespread at 
				European contact.</p>

				<p>Archery was highly developed in Asia. The Sanskrit term for archery, dhanurveda, came to refer to martial arts in general. In East Asia, 
				Goguryeo, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea was well known for its regiments of exceptionally skilled archers.</p>
